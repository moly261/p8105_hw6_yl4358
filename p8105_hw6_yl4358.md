I choose baby’s length at birth(`blength`), mother’s weight at
delivery(`delwt`) and average number of cigarettes(`smoken`) smoked per
day during pregnancy as predictor variables. Because baby’s birth weight
is highly related with the mother’s health status, I choose `delwt` and
`smoken` which represents mother’s health status during pregnancy.
According to common sense, the taller the baby is , the heavier the baby
is, thus I also choose `blength`.

``` r
birthweight_df %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(my_fit) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(my_fit) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + geom_point(alpha=.4 ) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```

According to the plot, the residuals of this model have an average about
0 and constant variance.

``` r
fit1 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight_df)

fit2 = lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = birthweight_df)

cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight_df, 100) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble)) %>% 
  mutate(my_fit  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + delwt + smoken, data = .x)),
         fit1  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
         fit2  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = .x))) %>% 
  mutate(rmse_my_fit = map2_dbl(my_fit, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_fit1 = map2_dbl(fit1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_fit2 = map2_dbl(fit2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))


cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```

Accordint to the `rmse`, the model using head circumference, length,sex
and all interactions is the best, the model using length at birth and
gestational age is the next, and my fitting model is the worse.

# Problem 2

    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
